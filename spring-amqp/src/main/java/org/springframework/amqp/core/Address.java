/**
 * Represents an address for publication of an AMQP message. The AMQP 0-8 and 0-9 specifications have an unstructured
 * string that is used as a "reply to" address. There are however conventions in use and this class makes it easier to
 * follow these conventions, which can be easily summarised as:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * (exchangeType)://(exchange)/(routingKey)
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Here we also allow the exchange type to default to direct, and the exchange name to default to empty (so just a
 * routing key will work if you know the queue name).
